## About Me

I'm a \*nix enthusiast who programs for fun though I'm probably the laziest guy you'll ever meet.<br>
I love music and anime, and have insanely large collections for each.<br>
I also like to play around in Blender a bit, as you can tell from my banner.<br>

## Why I'm on Here
I'm on here because there are no better alternatives (currently -- for me).<br>
<i>codeberg</i> forces licensing approved by a sham organization and another one that is shady at best.<br>
<i>sourcehut</i> is actually very amazing, I have used (and paid for) it in the past.<br>
The problem is that I would feel bad not paying for it, and I kinda have no income right now.<br>
<i>sourceforge</i> yeah, not a chance sorry.<br>

And another thing, when I share code, it's because I'd love for others to use it.<br>
As bad as this sounds, GitHub is "where it's at" when it comes to code sharing.<br>
I've had people blatantly refuse to use my software,<br>
along with some very angry (and honestly out there) rants about not using GitHub.<br>
So even if I did use something else, it would have to be something that people would actually use.
